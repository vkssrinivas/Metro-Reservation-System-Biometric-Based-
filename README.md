# Metro-Reservation-System-Biometric-Based-

ABSTRACT

The Metro Reservation System (biometric based) is a cutting-edge solution designed to address the problems associated with traditional paper-based ticketing systems at metro stations. The system provides a more efficient and convenient method for passengers to book and manage their metro reservations, by using biometric authentication to grant access to reservation details.

The system allows passengers to view train schedules, reserve seats, and pay for their reservations using a secure payment gateway. By implementing a biometric-based system, passengers can quickly and securely access their reservation details without the need for physical tickets or manual checks. Additionally, the system provides real-time updates on train schedules, seat availability, and station information, allowing passengers to plan their journey more effectively.

The Metro Reservation System (biometric based) not only enhances the overall passenger experience but also increases the efficiency and revenue of the metro service provider. The system reduces the workload for metro employees, allowing them to focus on other aspects of providing quality service to passengers. This innovative system is a step towards a more efficient and sustainable public transportation system.
